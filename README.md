# Algortihms & Data Structures in Java

This repository contains some algorithms that can be used in any application as well as a wide variety of data structures. These two concepts are really crucial for software engineering and one needs to understand at least how some of them works in order to become a better programmer. That's also why I am creating this repository: To improve myself and extend my vision of coding. I will keep this repository updated as I learn new things.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

A basic understanding of Java and built-in Java classes is needed to understand these algorithms. You should also have access to a Java IDE and some version of JDK.

### Algorithms




### Data Structures

- 1- Singly Linked Lists (https://github.com/sinasen2000/Algorithms-Data-Structures/blob/master/Data%20Structures/src/SinglyLinkedList.java)

## Contributors

Throughout the completion of this repository, I will be using numerous different resources to learn the concepts and I will update this section.

- 1- Data Structures & Algorithms in Java book, published by Wiley, written by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser.
